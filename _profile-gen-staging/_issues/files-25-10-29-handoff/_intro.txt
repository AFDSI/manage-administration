in the dialog labelled `profile-configuration-12` we were discussing building a refernce document to guide new projects and insure existing projects stay on course.
The topic of that document is Architecture Decision Record. The document is ADR-001-Data-Driven-Architecture.md.
This dialog is labelled `profile-configuration-13`.
The handoff from `profile-configuration-12` is HANDOFF-2025-10-27.md and HANDOFF-TO-13.md - attached.
Also attached is lessons-learned-powershell.md which is used to refresh knowledge about previously resolved PowerShell issues.
When loaded, it reminds Claude of previous decisions about and correction to PowerSHell code.
Similarly, ADR-001-Data-Driven-Architecture.md will establish principles for new projects and remind Claude of previous decisions about and correction to application design.

Please implement your offer: "Let me create a formal ADR for you:"
