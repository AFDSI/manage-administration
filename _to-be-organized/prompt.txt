Please help me improve this Claude project specification.
Please identify missing or incomplete information needed to implement the project.

Our strategic objective is to refactor `amp.dev` to be portable and reusable for similar web site development projects.
Portable means that all fixed variables ("hard wired" variables) are identified and can be reconfigured for new companies and new domains.
Reuseable means that fixed workflows can be easily reconfigured to support new develop teams creating new content for new companies and their domains.

Attached are Google specific `amp.dev` files.
By design, they are for a specific site - `https://amp.dev` - and for a specific business objectives.

For our objectives, the files must be generalized.

The first collection specify platforms on which amp.dev build versions run

\upload-tmp\environments-google
```
development.json
local.json
production.json
staging.json
static-test.json
```

The second collection are files that specify the workflow.
The main file is `deploy.yaml`.
The only significant variable is NETLIFY_DEPLOY_TOKEN which is specific to a repo - `amp.dev`.
In contrast, our objective is to support six sites, each using a unique NETLIFY_DEPLOY_TOKEN.
 
\upload-tmp\workflows-google
```
deploy.yaml
lint.yaml
sync-doc.yaml
test-platform.yaml
test-playground.yaml
```

Attached are "empty" templates Claude should complete based on requirements and values.

\upload-tmp\environments-new
```
development.json
local.json
production.json
staging.json
static-test.json
```

\upload-tmp\workflows-new
```
deploy.yaml
lint.yaml
sync-doc.yaml
test-platform.yaml
test-playground.yaml
```

Inititially we will skip working on `production.json`.
Reason: we have not yet specied a new busines domain.
Currently, our domains are managed by AWS.
Our plan it to transfer one domain - `benetta.io` - from AWS to Netlify.
Then we can specify `production.json`.
In addition we can aliign the following Google services with `benetta.io`
* Google Programmable Search (GPS) key
* Google site verification ID
* Google Analytics key
* Google Knowledge Graph key
* Google Maps key
Only then can we test, for example, GPS as the key is specific to `benetta.io`.
It is too difficult to register Netlify domains with Google services.

Short term, we will use `staging.json` where different GitHub branches will be test.
Staging is for unit testing and integration testing (but not for systems testing, which is performed for `benetta.io`)
Here is an active Netlify instance:
Site: https://ngfalls.netlify.app/
Project: https://app.netlify.com/projects/ngfalls/overview
GitHub repo: https://github.com/AFDSI/jay.dev
NETLIFY_DEPLOY_TOKEN: 7235a350-a231-4df3-9ed8-a1d7157ad331

For `amp.dev.20` we will use:
Project: https://app.netlify.com/projects/lighthearted-genie/overview
GitHub repo: https://github.com/AFDSI/amp.dev.20
NETLIFY_DEPLOY_TOKEN: 99d1e49c-fad5-472c-8b58-006bfb9c6941

Optional:
Use `static-test.json`
A specific Google programmer used `static-test.json`
We might consider using `static-test.json` as a method to isolate a specific content developer (contractor) deploying test pages for preview and acceptance.
The `static-test.json` method might enable developer partitioning.
However, it may add complexity to a build process without significantly improving content management.
Claude should develop and express an opinion here.

Finally, attached is draft documentation.

\upload-tmp\documentation
```
_commands-gh-initialize-remote-repo.md
_commands-git-branch-strategy-for-netlify.md
_commands-git-push-local-to-remote.md
_commands-netlify-management-messages.md
```

It is irregular and incomplete.
Documentation should be improved to integrate GitHub and Netlify management.
It should document a deplyment process from beginning to end.
Beginning is initiating, from a CLI, a new GitHub repo.
Ending should be commands to deploy a repo on a Netlify server for preview and acceptance.
