For analyzing repository files, we need to create relevant repository subsets and package target files in zip format.
Attached is `collector.sh` and a sample subset `collector.list`.
Please verify that the combination will generate compressed files that can be open and read when analyzing repository files.
Please propose process improvements where appropriate.
